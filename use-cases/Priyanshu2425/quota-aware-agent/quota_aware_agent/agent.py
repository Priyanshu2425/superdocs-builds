"""An agent that checks its allowance before planning, sizes the work to fit,
and degrades in plain language instead of failing halfway.

The shape of the problem, from the docs rather than from optimism:

  You cannot read your balance on demand. `/v1/users/me/usage` and `/limits`
  reject `sk_` keys with a 401. The agent-key path is `GET /v1/agents/whoami`
  once at the start, and after that the `usage` block that rides on every chat
  response. So the balance is authoritative at the start and after each call,
  and an *estimate* in between. `Balance.authoritative` carries that
  distinction so a report can never present a stale number as a live read.

The consequence worth naming: this agent does not "check remaining allowance"
continuously. It reads it, plans against it, and re-reads it as a side effect
of every call it makes. That is the strongest guarantee the platform allows,
and the report says which number it used.
