"""The four-call contract: upload, edit instruction, approve, export.

Everything here is grounded in the SuperDocs documentation, and the three traps
the docs name by hand are handled explicitly rather than discovered later:

  Trap 1 -- the double parse. A `proposed_change_batch` envelope carries its
    payload as a JSON-encoded *string* in `content`. `parse_proposed_changes`
    does the second parse. Skipping it is the documented single most common
    reason integrators see empty diff cards with every field undefined.

  Trap 2 -- silence is not a crash. A job on a large document can run for
    minutes with no visible progress. `poll_job` treats a long quiet run as
    still processing and only gives up at an explicit deadline, reporting how
    long it waited rather than calling it a failure.

  Trap 3 -- the allowance. Every response carries a `usage` block; nothing here
    spends without handing that block back to the caller to reconcile.

Transport is injected. `HttpTransport` is the real one; the tests pass a fake,
which is why this file has no network dependency and the suite needs no key.
