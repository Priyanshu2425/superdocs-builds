"""The MCP surface. Band S1 says MCP, and agents are who this serves.

Everything here is a thin wrapper over `QuotaAwareAgent`, which is already
tested. No planning logic lives in this file -- if it did, the MCP path and the
library path could disagree about what fits inside an allowance, and only one
of them would be tested.

The tools mirror how an agent actually works:

    check_allowance    -- what have I got? (free; the one authoritative read)
    plan_work          -- what fits inside it? (free; spends nothing, decides nothing)
    run_work           -- do the part that fits, and tell me what you left out.
    resolve_operation  -- a person's answer about a call that was started and never
                          confirmed. Free. Without it that step could never run again,
                          which is a state the surface could enter and not leave.

`plan_work` exists as a separate tool on purpose. An agent that must commit to
work before it can find out what fits is the exact failure this build is about,
so the plan is readable without spending anything.
