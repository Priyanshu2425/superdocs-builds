"""BudgetGuard -- never start work you cannot finish.

SHARED CORE. This module is used unchanged by another system by the same
author, where it guards the publisher that writes documents back to SuperDocs.
It is vendored here rather than imported so this build stands alone in its own
repository. Reuse is only a shortcut when it is hidden, so it is stated here and
in the README.

Grounded in the SuperDocs documentation rather than in the task brief
(TASK.md rule 1). Two facts from the docs shape this module:

  * Most requests bill one operation; very large ones bill one per 25 sections
    edited. So pricing is done in sections and reported in operations.
  * The usage endpoints reject API keys -- `/v1/users/me/usage` and `/limits`
    accept web-app session tokens only. From an API-key context the balance is
    read off the `usage` block that rides on every chat response. You therefore
    learn your balance as a side effect of doing work, not in advance of it.

That second point is why `Balance` carries `authoritative`. Between calls the
number is an estimate and says so. `quota_exhausted` on a response is the
authoritative stop signal.

A SECOND ceiling exists when the build runs through the shared relay, which
lends the SuperDocs key under a ration of a few hundred operations per key per
day. It is modelled here rather than beside here, because "how many operations
may I spend?" already has an owner and a second answer to the same question
kept somewhere else is how a planner ends up sizing work against a number that
was never the binding one. So the ration is a `Balance` like any other, and
`remaining()` returns whichever ceiling is lower -- you may spend what BOTH
allow, and the report names which one is doing the stopping.

Its authority runs the other way round from the monthly allowance, and that is
the point of expressing it in the same vocabulary rather than as a counter. The
relay states nothing about the ration on a successful response, so a ration
number we are carrying is always `authoritative=False` -- an estimate, exactly
like the monthly number between calls. The one authoritative reading is the
refusal: `budget_exhausted` means it is gone, which is the same shape of fact as
`quota_exhausted` and reaches the planner the same way.

    cannot answer: **do these changes ride in one request, or in several?**
    The docs price a *request* -- "most requests bill one operation; very large
