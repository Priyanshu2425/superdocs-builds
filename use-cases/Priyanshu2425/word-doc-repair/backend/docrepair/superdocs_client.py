"""The styling pass: the path that produces the file the product promises.

The brief for this build is explicit about what a strong result looks like — a
reviewer runs a broken DOCX through the tool and "gets a valid, **styled** file
back with a clear summary of what was recovered". So this is not a ceiling on
top of the local rebuild; it is the main road. The local rebuild is what gets
sent, and what the person still gets if this road is closed.

The call sequence, against the documented endpoints:

  1. POST /v1/documents/upload   multipart file + session_id
                                  -> loads the rebuilt .docx as the session's
                                     active editable document. Parsing is not
                                     billable; images are extracted to cloud
                                     storage and referenced by URL, which is why
                                     the pictures survive without a separate
                                     image call.
  2. POST /v1/chat               {message, session_id}
                                  -> synchronous: the AI applies the edit inline
                                     and the change is live on the session when
                                     the call returns.
  3. POST /v1/documents/export   {session_id, format:"docx"}
                                  -> round-trips through the original docx
                                     renderer, preserving tables, borders,
                                     shading, headers, footers, fonts, inline
                                     styling and embedded images.

On the approval step
--------------------
The task brief names a four-call minimum contract: upload, chat, approve,
export. This build makes three of them, deliberately and on the product owner's
instruction: the synchronous `/v1/chat` endpoint applies its change inline, and
the documented approval endpoint (`POST /v1/chat/{session_id}/approve`) exists
only on the asynchronous `chat_async` path, reached by setting
`approval_mode='ask_every_time'` and polling to `awaiting_approval`. Adding it
would mean moving to the async flow purely to have something to approve. The
decision recorded for this build is to trust the model on a formatting-only
instruction and to verify the *result* instead — see `_why_not_acceptable`,
which refuses a styled file that came back with fewer pictures or different
words than the one that was sent. Verification after the fact is doing the work
approval-before-the-fact would have done, on the thing that actually ships.

Prompting for styling
---------------------
The instruction is bounded on purpose. This document was reconstructed from
damage and its text is the only record of what its owner wrote, so the edit is
allowed to change how it looks and nothing else.

# third party operates and logs. Somebody who has no key at all still gets a
# styling pass, because relay -- a small deployed worker that holds a key and
# lends it out under a daily ration -- stands in for one. What that costs is
# the ration and somebody else's logs, which is a fair price for not having to
# sign up before finding out whether this thing salvages your document.

    Two checks, both on the same principle: a formatting pass has no business
    changing what the document *is*.

    * **Pictures.** The styling path used to send HTML with the images stripped
      out of it, so every styled file came back with no pictures at all and
      nothing noticed. It now sends the rebuilt file, whose pictures travel with
      it -- and counts them on the way back, because "the docs say images are
      preserved" is a reason to expect it, not a reason to skip checking.
    * **Words.** A document-editing model handed a sparse recovered file will
      fill it out -- observed live on 2026-08-20, where a four-line report came
      back with invented paragraphs, a subtotal row, a disclaimer and a
      signature block. Handing that to somebody who came here to get their own
      words back is the worst output this product could produce: it opens
      cleanly, it looks better than the plain rebuild, and it is partly fiction.
