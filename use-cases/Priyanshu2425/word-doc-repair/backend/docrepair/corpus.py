"""The measured corpus: real documents, one named fault each, and the truth.

`tests/broken.py` breaks one document eight ways so a failing test names the
fault it was meant to survive. That is a *test* corpus — it answers "does this
still work", not "how much comes back". This module answers the second question,
and it needs three things that one do not:

**Documents this package did not write.** A repair tool tested only against its
own output is tested against its own assumptions. Three of the five base
documents here were authored by other software — Google Docs, Apple's
`textutil`, and the converter behind the Open Preservation Foundation's
`variations` set — and their XML is laid out in ways this package would never
produce.

**Damage sorted by what it destroys**, because a recovery rate that mixes the
two kinds is not a number about anything. A missing `[Content_Types].xml`
removes no words: anything short of full recovery is a defect. A download cut
off at 30% removes most of them: full recovery is impossible and claiming it
would be a lie. Those cannot share a denominator, so they do not — see
`Damage.kind`.

**Ground truth that the repair path had no hand in.** `text_of` scrapes `<w:t>`
runs out of a document part with the standard library and nothing else. It reads
the intact original to get the truth and the rebuilt file to get the result, so
both sides of every ratio are measured by the same function, and that function
shares no code with the thing being measured.
