"""The web page. This is the product; the CLI is the same engine with a
different front door.

Progress is streamed as Server-Sent Events, not simulated: the recovery runs on
a worker thread and pushes each stage as it happens, and the response ends with
a final event carrying the manifest. A page that fakes a progress bar after the
work is already done is lying to the person watching it.

One flow, one file at the end of it. The brief for this build says a strong
result is a reviewer running a broken DOCX through the tool and getting "a
valid, **styled** file back with a clear summary of what was recovered", so the
styling pass is part of the recovery and not a button beside it.

  1. the local rebuild reads the damaged file and writes a clean one, and
  2. that file goes to SuperDocs to be styled, and the styled file is what is
     handed over.

Step 2 can fail in every way a network call can fail. When it does, the person
gets the local rebuild and a sentence saying why — the plain file is the
fallback, not the product. Both files stay downloadable either way, because
somebody who preferred the plain one should not have to run it again to get it.
